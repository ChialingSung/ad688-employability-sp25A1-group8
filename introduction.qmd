## 🧭 Introduction

Gender inequality in the labor market remains a persistent challenge—despite decades of progress toward workplace equity.

### 🌍 Global Context

Over the past two decades, gender equality in the **global labor market** has improved significantly. However, disparities in **hiring**, **pay**, and **career advancement** remain pervasive. According to [@ilo2023wage], women earned, on average, **20% less than men globally in 2023**. Moreover, women continue to be underrepresented in **leadership positions** and **high-paying industries**, highlighting enduring barriers to upward mobility.

These disparities are not just issues of fairness—they have broader implications for **economic growth**, **business performance**, and **societal well-being**. Persistent wage inequality, occupational segregation, and gender discrimination hinder women’s full participation in the labor force and reduce long-term economic sustainability.

### 🇺🇸 The U.S. Divide: Politics and Policy

In the United States, gender inequality is further shaped by **state-level political ideologies**. Labor policies—such as **minimum wage regulations**, **paid parental leave**, and **workplace protections**—differ significantly between **conservative (red)** and **liberal (blue)** states. These policy differences create variation in **wage equality** and **female workforce participation** [@blau2017gender].

As labor policies diverge, it becomes increasingly important to examine how institutional and political contexts influence gendered employment patterns. This intersection of gender and politics serves as a core focus of our research.

Gender disparities in the labor market not only impact individual opportunity—they shape macro-level outcomes. Research has shown that:

- Women are systematically overrepresented in **lower-paying**, **caregiving-oriented industries** such as education and healthcare.
- Male-dominated industries like technology and engineering often offer higher wages and faster advancement.
- State-level policy environments influence how accessible these opportunities are to women.

Additionally, differences in **wage transparency laws**, **parental leave provisions**, and **anti-discrimination enforcement** can either widen or narrow the gender wage gap.

This project investigates these structural forces, aiming to translate data into insights that inform more equitable workforce policies.

## 📈 Key Trends in 2024

Several timely developments make this study especially relevant:

1. **Persistent Pay Gap**  
   [@blau2017gender] found that the pace of closing the gender pay gap **slowed after 2010**, and that **38% of the current gap remains unexplained** by factors such as education or experience. This suggests the ongoing presence of implicit bias or structural barriers within industries.

2. **Ongoing Gender Segregation by Industry**  
   Despite efforts toward inclusion, women remain **overrepresented in education and healthcare**, and make up **less than 30%** of the workforce in engineering and computer science [@bls2023labor].

These trends reflect not only enduring inequalities, but also opportunities for policy-driven change.

## 🔮 Expected Findings

Our study is expected to reveal two primary trends:

1. **Gendered Hiring Patterns Across Industries**  
   Men are expected to continue dominating **STEM-related** and **technical fields**, while women will remain more concentrated in **healthcare** and **education** [@basu2023gender].

2. **Policy Influence on Gender Equality**  
   States with **progressive labor policies** (blue states) are likely to perform better in terms of closing the gender wage gap and improving access to high-paying industries. Conversely, conservative states may experience **larger wage gaps** and **lower rates of female career advancement** [@padova2024gender].

By integrating job posting and labor data across sectors and states, we aim to identify how **policy environments interact with labor market structure** to shape employment outcomes.

## 📚 Literature Review

Our research builds on a wide base of empirical studies that examine both **gender-based discrimination** and **political influences** on labor markets.

- [@campero2019gender] show that the gender composition of the existing workforce influences hiring outcomes: applicants of the non-dominant gender often face disadvantages.
- [@gorman2005gender] emphasizes the role of **gender stereotypes** and **group biases** in hiring criteria, showing that masculine-coded traits reduce women’s chances in male-dominated fields.
- [@birkelund2022gender] conduct a cross-national analysis, revealing minimal discrimination against women but notable bias against men in some countries—suggesting that cultural and institutional factors matter deeply.

Other studies explore the **political dimension** of gendered labor patterns:

- [@may2017gender] demonstrate that conservative-leaning states tend to exhibit **greater occupational segregation** by gender, while blue states have more integrated labor markets.
- [@mcveigh2007red] link these labor patterns to political behavior, arguing that Republican-leaning counties reinforce gender divisions through both economic structures and ideological beliefs.

Together, these findings underscore our central hypothesis:  
> **Gender-based disparities are not merely the result of individual bias or firm-level decisions, but are embedded in broader social, political, and institutional systems.**

## 🔗 Summary

This introduction establishes the basis for our analysis of gender inequality across U.S. labor markets.  
Through data-driven methods and machine learning models, we seek to understand how occupational segregation and wage inequality are shaped by both **industry dynamics** and **state-level policy environments**—and how these forces intersect to influence opportunity, representation, and equity in the workforce.
