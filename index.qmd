## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates gender disparities in the U.S. labor market with a focus on wage inequality, occupational segregation, and the influence of political environments on gendered employment patterns.

Using real-world job posting and employment data, we explore:

- Persistent gender pay gaps despite similar education or experience  
- Overrepresentation of women in specific industries (e.g., education, healthcare)  
- Effects of state-level labor policies on gender equality  

We apply machine learning and natural language processing to extract insights and support **evidence-based policy recommendations**.
